For the trackball case, I've modified the open source Ploopy trackball nano.
The case has been scaled to fit a 40mm ball (which I took from a second hand Logitech trackman marble).

## Case
You'll need to 3D print the case with supports.

## Bearings
The case still fits these bearings, which I bought from here:

## PCB
I used a second hand Xiaomi mouse. I think it's this version: XMSBO1MW


Make sure you test first and make sure that the sensor (now facing upwards) is an appropriate distance from the ball, and that other pointing devices are disconnected from your computer.
If the ball is too close to the sensor you might get unintentional tracking. If the sensor is too far away from the ball the cursor won't move. You may also need to adjust how far the bearings are seated in the housing if the ball is touching the sensor.

## Screws
You can drill pilot holes using PCB as a template and a 1.5mm drill bit. You can use the screws from the mouse to fix the PCB to the top half of the case.
You'll also need a screw to hold the top and bottom halves. I used a M3 x 10mm bolt.

## Batteries
You'll need 2xAAA batteries.  The holder is a remix from this STL:

The batteries face downwards for easy removal.
I used the terminals from the original mouse and clipped the springs.  You'll need to take note of which side is positive and which is negative for the batteries.

## Ball
I used the 40mm ball from my Logitech Trackman Marble.  

I also bought a cheap, hollow stainless steel ball off AliExpress. I needed to scratch the surface of the steel ball with a brass bristled brush before it would track. the ball is not completely symmetrical. In short, the ball works, but the experience is not ideal.
