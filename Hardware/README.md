For the trackball case, I've modified the open source Ploopy trackball nano.
The case has been scaled to fit a 40mm ball (which I took from a second hand Logitech trackman marble).

You'll need to 3D print the case.


The case still fits these bearings, which I bought from here:

I used a second hand Xiaomi mouse. I think it's this version:

You can drill a very small pilot hole and use the screws from the mouse to fix the PCB to the top half of the case.
