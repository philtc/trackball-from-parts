**This is currently a work in progress - things are probably a bit/very broken. Use at your own peril**

There are a few tutorials floating around that show you how to convert a mouse into a trackball really cheaply. Most of these tutorials are incomplete.
This repository adds to these, with the intent of building a trackball (re)using cheap and readily available parts and existing software.

The repository is divided into two parts:
1. The hardware - 3D printed parts, PCB, buttons etc.
2. The software - links and information relating to jfedor's amazing work
