**This is currently a work in progress - things are probably a bit/very broken. Use at your own peril**

There are a few tutorials floating around that show you how to convert a mouse into a trackball really cheaply. Most of these tutorials are incomplete.
This repository adds to these, with the intent of building a trackball (re)using cheap and readily available parts and existing software.

I am currently using this as my daily pointing device, and works well enough for my needs.  Your mileage may vary.

The repository is divided into two parts:
1. The hardware - 3D printed parts, PCB, buttons etc.
2. The software - links and information relating to jfedor's amazing work


## Requirements
* Basic soldering (for battery terminals, button(s), and HID remapper)
* Access to a 3D printer or 3D printing services
* New and/or second-hand parts
  * Mouse
  * Trackball ball
  * Rollers
  * (Optional) button
  * A [HID remapper](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper) by [jfedor2](https://github.com/jfedor2) including RP2040 and USB-A female port
